                    In today’s industry, every organization invests and puts a lot of emphasis in information technology due to the modern times being heavily reliant on technology. Companies hire professionals who can implement, improve, and discover new technology for the greater good and efficiency of a company. The data collected is used to make important decisions and how to achieve business goals.</br>

				<div data-aos="fade-up" align="justify" style="line-height: 1.6em;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">
				Shortly after graduation, I was hired at Great-West Life as an Associate Systems Analyst. At work, I have the opportunity to apply what we learn in the MIS courses at Asper every day!  In my short time here, I have been exposed to various different aspects of systems analysis and design, including gathering requirements,  creating diagrams (Swimlane and ERD so far, although many others are used here), testing, writing queries, and problem analysis, among others on a daily basis. These are not just skills that you learn about in class, they are very much used in the  “real-world”, and are great skills to have. Currently, I support the systems used in the Group Policies Division at GWL.

                <u data-aos="fade-up" style="font-size: 1.68em;margin-bottom: 20px;font-weight: 400;line-height: 1.6em; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; text-decoration: none;"><b>How has your MIS education helped you? </b></u></br>
                <div data-aos="fade-up" align="justify" style="line-height: 1.6em;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">
                The Asper MIS program has helped me in numerous ways, both professionally and personally. The skills that you practice in class will being very valuable upon graduation, and the MIS courses I took throughout my degree have prepared me for the “real world”.  The many networking events I attended throughout my time at Asper allowed me to make connections and learn how to network effectively, and the MISA annual networking event,  Biztek, was an invaluable way to make connections in the MIS/IS community in Winnipeg. I interviewed at a few different companies upon graduation, and encountered many of the reps that I met at Biztek throughout these interviews. It helps to have that connection both during the hiring process, as well as in the workplace.

                <u data-aos="fade-up" style="font-size: 1.68em;margin-bottom: 20px;font-weight: 400;line-height: 1.6em; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; text-decoration: none;"><b>What has MISA done for you?</b></u></br>
                <div data-aos="fade-up" align="justify" style="line-height: 1.6em;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">
                During my time at Asper, I was involved with MISA and served as President in my graduating year. Involvement in extracurricular activities was never “my thing”, but I decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did! In my experience, employers are very impressed by students that show the initiative to become involved. I believe that my involvement with MISA was instrumental in getting my foot in the door and standing out among other candidates, and it also provided me with a good reason to connect to these reps while organizing activities. I believe that if it weren’t for MISA, I wouldn’t have had the same opportunities that I had to interview at the organizations that I wanted to work at upon graduation, and I’m not sure I would be where I am today.
