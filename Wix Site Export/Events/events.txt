BIZTEK
Biztek is our annual social event where members can network with managers, partners, and HR
professionals from different companies. We offer wine & cheese and dinner for the participants.
During the event, we usually have guest speakers from 1-2 companies. Our goal for Biztek is to
equip students with a chance to network with professionals whom may give them great insights
on the MIS industry. Biztek can also be an opportunity for students to experience business social
events, be friends with companies' representatives, or even get a job offer after talking to
them. Some of the employers who joined us for last year’s Biztek include Investors Group, Great
West Life, Wawanesa, and International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA).

MONTHLY MEETINGS
MISA invites one to two guest speakers whose position or job is related to IT and MIS, to
introduce current workplace environment, bright future, and job opportunities for MIS students.
We do offer food and drinks for free! This is a good opportunity for members to know each other
and to discuss some of the questions about the topic given by the speaker in order to better
understand MIS.

BUDDY DAY
MISA sets up a booth at Asper and our executive team will be there to introduce MIS major
and MISA events to all students who pass by. We are there to answer any questions about our team
and our major - MIS. We also have many souvenirs to give out, such as pens, notebooks, USBs,
T-shirts, and so on. 


Come visit us and get your gifts! We’re looking forward to seeing and meeting MISA members
and having new members joining us!
