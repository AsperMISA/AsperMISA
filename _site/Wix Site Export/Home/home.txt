What is MIS?

What we can offer to you
MISA's purpose is to help students who are interested 
in business technology to discover opprtunities that can help 
them apply their classroom knowledge into real word 
scenarios. We also set up networking opprtunities for MISA 
members, this can give sutdents a chance to build relationships
with MIS professionals. Another role of MISA is to share co-op
and internship oppurtunities for anyone who is interested. Our
MISA monthly meetings include guest speaker sessions where
an industry professional would talk about current topics and
trends in MIS or new technologies that are newly discovered
within the study of MIS. Our monthly meetings also give
students a chance to meet new friends who also share the same
passion for business technology.

About us

critical component in how modern businesses are run and 
how to achieve their business goals, making MIS a valuable 
program in today's job market.
